# Optimization Project: Bin packing problem
> Modeling and implimenting some methods to solve bin packing problem with upper bound, lower bound
- Generate data.py: random initialize truck's information (lower bound, upper bound) and item's information (weight, value)
- Backtracking.py: solve problem with backtracking algorithm
- MIP.py: mixed interger programming using package Ortools
- CP.py: constraint programming using package Ortools
- Heuristic.py: heuristic strategy for solving problem
- data_8_3.txt, data_10_3.txt: random data generated by "Generate data.py"
